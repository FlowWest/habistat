<span class="key_takeaways">
A variety of hydrologic and geospatial attributes were collected for all stream reaches within the study area (the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins, HUC-4 hydrologic subregions 1802 and 1804). The basis of stream reach delineation is the ComID reach as defined in [NHDPlusV2](https://nhdplus.com/NHDPlus/NHDPlusV2_home.php). Attributes include local characteristics like stream gradient, sinuosity, and depth to bedrock; upstream drainage characteristics like drainage area size, elevation, mean annual precipitation, and soil erodibility; and custom modeled confinement measures like topographic position index (mTPI) and levee confinement.

### Topographic and Spatial Confinement Indicators

- **Reach Topographic Position Index (mTPI)** (`mtpi30_min`) mTPI is a measure of topographic position^[Theobald, D. M., Harrison-Atlas, D., Monahan, W. B. & Albano, C. M. (2015). Ecologically-relevant maps of landforms and physiographic diversity for climate adaptation planning. PLOS ONE. https://10.1371/journal.pone.0143619] calculated by comparing local elevation to a neighborhood average. Negative values indicate canyons or valleys, near-zero indicates flat planes, and positive indicates ridges or peaks. To measure river confinement, mTPI was calculated at 90m, 270m, and 810m scales using the USGS NED DEM. Then, within a 15m buffer along each `comid` flowline, the minimum mTPI value was taken as a representative measure of the maximum  confinement of the channel. *Source: FlowWest draft spatial analysis, [source code located here](https://github.com/FlowWest/habistat/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/terrain-attributes.md#channel-confinement-via-mtpi)*.  

- **Valley Bottom Width** (`vb_width_transect`) An estimate of valley bottom width (meters) calculated using a variation of the slope cutoff method described by Guillon et al. (2019).^[Guillon, H., Byrne, C. F., Lane, B. A., Pasternack, G. B. & Sandoval-Solis, S. (2019). South Fork Eel River Basin Geomorphic Classification. Prepared for California State Water Resources Control Board. https://watermanagement.ucdavis.edu/download_file/view_inline/144. *"For the purposes of
this study, 25 percent slope was chosen as a threshold between valley bottom and valley wall
capturing a medial value between clay and sand dominated hill footslopes [Carson, M.A., 1972, Hillslope form
and process, University Press: Cambridge]."* ] First, for each `comid` flowline, the valley bottom was delineated by clipping its local NHDPlusV2 catchment polygon to the area of the USGS NED DEM, contiguous to the flowline, where slope was less than 25%. Then, a series oftransects were drawn perpendicular to the flowline, and the valley bottom width was measured along each transect. Finally, the transect widths were averaged, creating a single average valley bottom width value for each `comid`. *Source: FlowWest draft spatial analysis, [source code located here](https://github.com/FlowWest/habistat/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/terrain-attributes.md#valley-bottom-width-via-slope-cutoff-method)*.  

- **Valley Bottom:Channel Width Ratio** (`vb_bf_w_ratio`) The ratio of valley bottom width (`vb_width_transect`) to bankfull width (`bf_width_m`), creating a unitless measure of valley bottom width proportional to the size of the channel.

- **Reach Levee Confinement Fraction** (`frac_leveed_longitudinal`). The fraction of channel length that is adjacent to a levee. Ranges from 0 (no levees) to 1 (levees along entire length). Calculated by drawing perpendicular transects, then tabulating their intersection with levee polylines retrieved from the USACE National Levee Database (data retrieved 2024-02-16). *Source: FlowWest draft spatial analysis, [source code located here](https://github.com/FlowWest/habistat/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/levees.md)*.  

- **Lateral Levee Confinement (ft)** (`lateral_levee_confinement_ft`) The average width of the stream corridor between adjacent levees or to the edge of the catchment. Currently `NA` if there are no levees alongside the stream reach. Calculated by drawing perpendicular transects, then tabulating their intersection with levee polylines retrieved from the USACE National Levee Database (data retrieved 2024-02-16). *Source: FlowWest draft spatial analysis, [source code located here](https://github.com/FlowWest/habistat/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/levees.md)*.   

### Categorical

  - *Valley Lowland* if flowline intersects with the *Valley Lowland* landscape type classification defined for the Chinook Salmon Habitat Quantification Tool (Whipple et al., 2019),^[Whipple A., T. Grantham, G. Desanker, L. Hunt, A. Merrill, B. Hackenjos, R. Askevold. 2019. Chinook Salmon Habitat Quantification Tool: User Guide (Version 1.0). Prepared for American Rivers.

  - *Valley Foothill* if flowline intersects with the delineated by Fault (2012),^[Faunt, C.C., 2012, Alluvial Boundary of California's Central Valley: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CQNCA9] *else*
  
  - *Bedrock* indicating any streams outside of these zones.

- **UCD Hydrologic Class** (`hyd_cls`) Hydrologic classifications developed by Lane et al. (2017)^[Lane, B. A., Dahlke, H. E., Pasternack, G. B. & Sandoval-Solis, S. (2017). Revealing the Diversity of Natural Hydrologic Regimes in California with Relevance for Environmental Flows Applications. *Journal of the American Water Resources Association* 53(2): 411-430. https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12504], including the following values:

  - *Snowmelt* (`SM`, `HLP`)
  - *Mixed* (`HSR`, `LSR`, `GW`)
  - *Rain* (`RGW`, `WS`, `PGR`, `FER`)

- **UCD Geomorphologic Class** (`geomorph_class`) Geomorphic channel types. 
  - For the Sacramento River basin, this variable includes the channel types by Guillon et al. (2020)^[Guillon, H., Byrne, C.F., Lane, B.A., Sandoval-Solis, S., and Pasternack G.B. (2020). Machine Learning Predicts Reach-Scale Channel Types from Coarse-Scale Geospatial Data in a Large River Basin. J. of Water Resources Research. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026691], referenced in the [California Environmental Flows Framework](https://ceff.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk5566/files/media/documents/Appendix_F%20Geomorphic%20Classification%20of%20CA.pdf) and [available on Dryad](https://doi.org/10.25338/B8031W)^[Guillon, Herv√© et al. (2020). Channel types predictions for the Sacramento River basin [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.25338/B8031W]. Channel types are as follows:
    - `SAC01` *Unconfined, boulder-bedrock, bed-undulating*
    - `SAC02` *Confined, boulder, high-gradient, step-pool/cascade*
    - `SAC03` *Confined, boulder-bedrock, uniform*

    - `SAC09` *Unconfined, low width-to-depth, gravel*
    - `SAC10` *Unconfined, gravel-cobble, riffle-pool*
  - For the San Joaquin basin, we trained a simple random forest classifier on the Sacramento reaches, using a series of covariates (slope, catchment drainage area, catchment minimum elevation, catchment maximum elevation, catchment relief, catchment mean annual precipitation, reach mTPI [topographic position index], reach gradient class, and hydrologic class), and used this to estimate the classifications for the San Joaquin reaches. These are rough estimates intended for use as input into the habistat model only. *Source: FlowWest draft statistical analysis, [source code located here](https://github.com/FlowWest/habistat/blob/main/data-raw/scripts/geomorph.md)*
